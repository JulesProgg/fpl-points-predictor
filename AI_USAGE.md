# Use of AI Tools

Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools were primarily used as **learning aids** and **debugging support** throughout the project.

# Debugging and Error Understanding

AI was particularly helpful in quickly understanding errors, especially by interpreting Python error messages and stack traces.  
This allowed for faster identification of issues and improved comprehension of why certain errors occurred, rather than relying on trial-and-error fixes.


# Evolution of AI Usage During the Project

At the beginning of the project, AI-generated code was sometimes used in a **copy-paste manner**, without a full understanding of every line.  
As a result, after spending a significant amount of time on the project, it became necessary to revisit and restructure large parts of the codebase in order to steer the project in the desired direction.

This experience highlighted the limitations of using AI-generated code without sufficient comprehension.


# Improved and Responsible Use in Later Stages

During the second half of the project, AI tools were used in a more effective and responsible way.  
All AI-generated suggestions were carefully reviewed, adapted, and fully understood before being integrated.

By the end of the project, every line of code produced with AI assistance was clearly understood, and AI served as a support tool rather than a substitute for reasoning or decision-making.


# Statement of Understanding and Responsibility

All submitted code reflects the author’s understanding.  
AI tools were used to assist learning, debugging, and clarification, in line with the course guidelines, and not to generate the project automatically.
